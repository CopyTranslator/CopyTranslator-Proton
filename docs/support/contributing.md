git clone --recursive https://github.com/copytranslator/CopyTranslator.git
cd CopyTranslator
yarn
yarn electron:build

## 请注意


## Locale settings
Using my own l10n module, for memory saving purpose. 
### For locale maintainers
If you want to add a new locale, follow the instructions below.

> view `json` files under `dist_locales` to see the format of the locale file, fork the repo and add a new `{{locale}}.json` file under the directory, and create a pull request.

Welcome to join the `gitter` chat room at [here](https://gitter.im/CopyTranslator/Lobby?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link), so you can get notified before new version release. You can create a pull request at any time as **the out of date locale file won't cause any error**, the program will go back to English for the missing words.
